Stupid todo + pomodoro app.

# Installation

Upon cloning the repo, run the following,

```
# Install dependencies,
npm install

# Build dist 
npm run build
```

You could either load the `dist/index.html` directly on the
browser or use the included express server to serve the files.
This can be done by running,
```
npm start
```
